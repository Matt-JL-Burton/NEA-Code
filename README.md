# NEA-Code
The repository for the code for my A level NEA project. This project will be a client side property managment system that will track if rent is paid, incomng/outgoing expenses and much much more. The System is made using mostly tkinter, matplotlib connected together through an SQL backend.

To see the fully detailed 30 thousand word (and growing) write up of what is this code is doing and why it is required, read my NEA which can be found at <I will add a link once I have sent of my NEA for marking>
